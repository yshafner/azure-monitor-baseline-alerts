In some cases, you may need to remove all resources deployed by the AMBA-ALZ solution. The following instructions provide a detailed guide on executing a PowerShell script to delete all deployed resources, including:

- Metric Alerts
- Activity Log Alerts
- Policy Assignments
- Policy Definitions
- Policy Set Definitions
- Policy Assignment remediation identity role assignments
- Action Groups
- Alert Processing Rules

All resources deployed as part of the initial AMBA deployment, as well as those created dynamically by 'deploy if not exist' policies, are tagged, marked in metadata, or described (depending on resource capabilities) with the value `_deployed_by_amba` or `_deployed_by_amba=True`. This metadata is crucial for the cleanup process; if it has been removed or altered, the cleanup script will not target those resources.

## Cleanup Script Execution

### Download the Script File

To download the cleanup script file, follow these steps. Alternatively, you can clone the repository from GitHub and ensure you are working with the latest version by fetching the latest `main` branch.

1. Navigate to the [AMBA project on GitHub](https://aka.ms/amba/repo).
2. Browse to the `patterns/alz/scripts` directory.
3. Open the **Start-AMBA-ALZ-Maintenance.ps1** script file.
4. Click the **Raw** button.
5. Save the file as **Start-AMBA-ALZ-Maintenance.ps1**.

### Executing the Script

1. Launch PowerShell.
2. Ensure the following modules are installed:
  - **Az.Accounts**: if not installed, use `Install-Module Az.Accounts` to install it.
  - **Az.Resources**: if not installed, use `Install-Module Az.Resources` to install it.
  - **Az.ResourceGraph**: if not installed, use `Install-Module Az.ResourceGraph` to install it.
  - **Az.ManagedServiceIdentity**: if not installed, use `Install-Module Az.ManagedServiceIdentity` to install it.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the **Start-ALZ-Maintenance.ps1** script.
4. Set the _**$pseudoRootManagementGroup**_ variable using the command below:

  ```powershell
  $pseudoRootManagementGroup = "The pseudo root management group ID parenting the identity, management and connectivity management groups"
  ```

5. Sign in to your Azure account using the `Connect-AzAccount` command. Ensure that the account has the necessary permissions to remove Policy Assignments, Policy Definitions, and resources at the required Management Group scope.
6. Run the script with one of the following options:

   **Get full help on script usage:**

  ```powershell
  Get-help ./Start-AMBA-ALZ-Maintenance.ps1
  ```

  **Show output of what would happen if deletes executed:**

  ```powershell
  ./Start-AMBA-ALZ-Maintenance.ps1 -pseudoRootManagementGroup $pseudoRootManagementGroup -cleanItems Amba-Alz -WhatIf
  ```

  **Execute the script asking for confirmation before deleting the resources deployed by AMBA-ALZ:**

  ```powershell
  ./Start-AMBA-ALZ-Maintenance.ps1 -pseudoRootManagementGroup $pseudoRootManagementGroup -cleanItems Amba-Alz
  ```

  **Execute the script <ins>without</ins> asking for confirmation before deleting the resources deployed by AMBA-ALZ:**

  ```powershell
  ./Start-AMBA-ALZ-Maintenance.ps1 -pseudoRootManagementGroup $pseudoRootManagementGroup -cleanItems Amba-Alz -Confirm:$false
  ```
