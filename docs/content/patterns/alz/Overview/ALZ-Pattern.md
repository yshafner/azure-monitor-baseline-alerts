## Overview

The Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA) for Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) is a best practice collection of alerts for resources commonly deployed in Azure landing zones. It demonstrates how to deploy alerts at scale using Azure Policy.

A frequent question from customers is, "What should we monitor in Azure?" and "What thresholds should we set for our alerts?"

There is not a definitive list of what to monitor when deploying to Azure because it depends on the services used and their usage patterns. This dictates what to monitor, the metrics to collect, and the errors to alert on.

Microsoft addresses this with various 'insights or solutions' for popular services, such as [Storage Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-insights-overview), [VM Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-overview), and [Container Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview). However, this does not cover everything.

This project focuses on monitoring for Azure Landing Zones, providing a common set of Azure resources/services configured similarly across organizations. It also includes guidance for custom brownfield scenarios that do not align with ALZ. This serves as a starting point for addressing "What should be monitored in Azure?" and demonstrates how to monitor at scale using Infrastructure-as-Code principles.

This project offers an opinionated view on monitoring key components of your Azure Landing Zone within the Platform and Landing Zone scope, including:

- Express Route Circuits
- Express Route Gateways
- Express Route Ports
- Azure Firewalls
- Application Gateways
- Load Balancers
- Virtual Networks
- Virtual Network Gateways
- Log Analytics Workspaces
- Private DNS Zones
- Azure Key Vaults
- Virtual Machines
- Service Health

Monitoring baselines for these components are deployed using Azure Policy and bundled into Azure Policy initiatives for ease of deployment and management. Additional component alerts included in the repository, but outside any initiatives or disabled by default, are:

- Storage Accounts
- Network Security Groups
- Azure Route Tables

The repository also contains policies for deploying service health alerts by subscription.

Alerts are based on Microsoft public guidance where available and practical application experience where not. For details on included alerts, refer to [Alert Details](../../Getting-started/Alerts-Details).

For information on how policies are grouped into initiatives, refer to [Azure Policy Initiatives](../../Getting-started/Policy-Initiatives).

Alerts need to be directed somewhere. A generic action group and alert processing rule is deployed to every subscription in scope via policy. For more details and the reasoning behind this approach, refer to [Monitoring and Alerting](../../Getting-started/Monitoring-and-Alerting).
