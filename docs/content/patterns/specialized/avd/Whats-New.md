### Deployment Names over 64 characters
An issue was discovered in which the deployment for some alerts would fail if the deployment name was over 64 characters. This was due to the Storage Account and/or ANF Volume names being too long and appended to the deployment name. Those names are now truncated if over 20 characters.

## 2024-01-25
### New features
Initial relocation from the Azure AVD Accelerator Brownfield with AVD specific Alerts on a per Host Pool basis.
- Session Host monitoring both on performance, AVD agent health, storage, and fslogix profiles

### Bug fixes
#### ISSUE #221
(Fixed on 6/28/2024)

Storage calculation script in the runbook which was yielding a much higher remaining value than truly existed. Values were in the 99.xx% range vs actual for remaining meaning the alert may never trigger when remaining storage is truly low.

Runbook: AvdStorageLogData
Script: Get-StorAcctInfo.ps1 line 46

Was --- $RemainingPercent = 100 - ($shareUsageInGB / $shareQuota)
New --- $RemainingPercent = 100 - ($shareUsageInGB / $shareQuota * 100)
